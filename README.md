# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It utilizes the Dayjs library for working with date and time.

## Usage
1. The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. Scroll down to view the timeblocks for each hour of the day.
3. Each timeblock will be color-coded based on whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. Click into a timeblock to enter an event or task.
5. After entering an event, click the save button to save it.
6. Saved events will persist even if you refresh the page.
